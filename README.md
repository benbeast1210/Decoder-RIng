> This project is an exercise in classic coding challenges. The Caesar Cipher, the Polybius Square, and the Substitution Cipher.


### Caesar Cipher - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

> One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
>> A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
>
> This cipher was supposedly created by its namesake to encode messages during the societal pinnacle of Rome. A message that reads "crossing the rubicon" 
> may have translated into "pebffvat gur ehovpba", depending on the shift number.
