## "Decoder Ring" - A 3-cipher encryption/decryption webpage

> This project is an exercise in classical coding challenges. The Caesar Cipher, the Polybius Square, and the Substitution Cipher.

### [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher/"target="_blank)

> One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
>> A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
>
> This cipher was supposedly created by its namesake to encode messages during the societal pinnacle of Rome. A message that reads "crossing the rubicon" 
> may have translated into "pebffvat gur ehovpba", depending on the shift value.

### [Polybius Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square/"target="_blank)

> The Polybius Square uses a 2D plane of 25 squares to arrange the alphabet, top-down, left to right. The result, is a series of 2 digit number combinations corresponding to a column/row sequence which is then translated into the letter found at the corresponding square. 
>> The letters 'i' and 'j' are handled in a unique way. Both letter represent the same 2 digit combination in my square, 45. 
>
> When decrypting, a user provides a series of 2 digit combinations as an input and they recieve a string as the output. While encrypting, the user needs to have their message ready and then simply retrieve the output given. 

### [Substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher/"target="_blank)

> The Substitution Cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the standard alphabet.
>> The influence of this cipher reached far beyond the musings of puzzle-breakers such as the audience of Sherlock Holmes' books. This cipher even has recorded impact in message transmission during World War II. Some of the ciphers derived from this particular one have gone on to be proven 'mathematically unbreakable'.
>
> This cipher requires the user to input the substitution alphabet as well as the desired message.
